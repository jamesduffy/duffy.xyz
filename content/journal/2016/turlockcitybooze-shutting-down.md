title: "TurlockCityBooze shutting down"
---

All great things must come to an end, unfortunately that time has come for TCB. I am no longer living in the Central Valley and I would not be able to keep the site up to date, so I made the tough decision to shut it down.

What was an idea during my last few semesters of college became a surprisingly successful website in Turlock.

TCB was a website that showed local bars and restaurants when they were having a happy hour along with beer reviews.

I had a lot of fun drinking.. -cough- I mean ‚Äúresearching‚Äù üçª, building a great site and meeting interesting people along the way.

I have taken the application that I wrote that powered the website and Open Sourced it so that someone could recreate the site if they wish.
