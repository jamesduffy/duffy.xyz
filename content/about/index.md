Hi! I am James Duffy. I currently work as a Lead Infrastructure Engineer.

I am passionate about my work and building things for the web. I live and work in San Francisco. Programming and scaling machines in the cloud is my norm. Most of my career has been building high traffic websites and the infrastructure that runs them.

My current focus is on building and managing infrastructure (servers, networking, etc.) with Terraform, setting up Kubernetes clusters and deployments, and building the continuous integration pipeline to deploy them.

# Projects
## Analytics-App.net
PHP website that connected to the AppDotNet Social Network fire hose and ingested all posts, likes, reposts and replies. It would find soon to be popular posts and share them as well as have daily top posts and users. It also had historical views so you could go back and see what was popular on what day. After AppDotNet shut down it's developer incentive program I was no longer able to afford to keep it running.

## Turlock City Booze
A website that was dedicated to showing you where there was a current Happy Hour in Turlock, California and some reviews of different restaurants. I shut down the site after graduating college and moving away from Turlock.
