A lot of people will cite that they decided to get their Amateur radio license to prepare for a disaster or an emergency. I agree that this is still a big part of the hobby, but Amateur radio (HAM Radio) is a hobby and not a job.

If you are getting into the hobby just for the usage during a disaster you will likely fall out of the hobby quickly and it will not be useful in a disaster because you would not have used your radio enough to make it effective.

Personally I have always been drawn to decentralized communication. It is part of the reason I am a software engineer today. I have always wanted to get my HAM Radio license (something that my dad has had since before I was born). It took me years to finally find the time to study and take the test.

I took my technician exam in October 2017 and finally joined the HAM hobby.
