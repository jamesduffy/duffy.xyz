Today was my last day working for Track Revenue. It was my first job after graduating from California State University, Stanislaus. I learned a lot in the 18 months as part of the Software Engineering team. I was challenged and there were struggles, but ultimately I came out better than I was before.

When I started working at Track Revenue I was still living at my parents and my girlfriend Aubrey was almost 2 hours away finishing her Senior year at Stan State. Now we live together in San Francisco and I could not be happier.

We are both about to take the plunge into something new. I am going to explore working full-time as a DevOps Engineer and she is going to be teaching 4th grade.

During my time at Track Revenue I helped build a lot of the infrastructure and help scale the service to many new customers. I hope that the work I have done will continue Track Revenue on the amazing path that it is on today. I am excited to see where the amazing team can take it.

What I learned while working is that I have a passion for working in DevOps and recently I have been given the opportunity to do it full-time.

It was a hard decision to make but ultimately I love building tools and automating tasks and this new opportunity will allow me to do just that.
