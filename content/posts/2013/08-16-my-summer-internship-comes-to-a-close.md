Today is it! I have learned a lot in the few short weeks I have been at IRIDEX Corporation and it has been a wonderful and eye opening experience and if I could I would stay longer, but alas I must finish up school.

IRIDEX is a leader “developing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative and versatile laser-based medical systems, delivery devices and consumable instrumentation for the ophthalmology and otolaryngology market” in the heart of Mountain View, California. Founded in 1989 before the Google Bike invasion they have successfully built a product line that will carry them into the next generation of medical devices.

My time at IRIDEX was spent researching, compiling, updating and writing component specifications to comply with the European Union’s RoHS (Restriction of Use of Hazardous Substances) 2011 directive. It required me to send 100′s of emails, make dozens of cold calls, and write/update documentation to meet and pass BSI audits.

I had to work directly with many internal departments including Product Development, Manufacturing, Manufacturing Engineers, Quality Assurance, Materials, Document Control and Regulatory. Externally I had to communicate our needs to many different suppliers in a large spectrum of industries.

I worked with two other interns and with them we nearly completed the documentation for two product platforms. They will be continuing onto two more platforms and probes.

I had learned a lot during my short time at IRIDEX and had a lot of fun along the way. There are a lot of smart and talented people working at IRIDEX and I will miss seeing them at the crack of dawn (my normal work day was 6:30am-3:30pm).
