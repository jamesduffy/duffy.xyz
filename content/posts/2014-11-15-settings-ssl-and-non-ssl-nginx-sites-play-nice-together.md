I learned the hard way recently the importance of setting additional Nginx server configurations when hosting both SSL and Non-SSL sites on the same machine.

When I created a new server with an SSL connection and did not set a connection reset for the other sites that were not using SSL I found Google and other search engines were showing the wrong URL in my search results.

<!--more-->

It took almost two weeks for the fix to propagate to all the search engines after I fixed it so donâ€™t make the same mistake I did.

<hr>

Make sure to create Nginx servers for HTTPS and HTTP for each website the machine will be hosting.

I made sure that the default configuration (IP without the domain or unknown server name would just reset the connection and not try to load another site. I also made sure that I forced SSL on sites that had it by redirecting users if they weren&#8217;t using SSL.

On sites that don&#8217;t use SSL I made a server running on SSL with the correct name that would reset the connection. I could possibly redirect the user back to an HTTP connection, but I don&#8217;t think it is necessary and have not tried it myself to make sure that it works.

HTTP Server IP connection reset (444)<br />
HTTPS Server IP connection reset (444)<br />
