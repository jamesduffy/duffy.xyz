Just ordered a new bicycle from State Bicycle. I will not be getting rid of my current specialized. I wanted to get a fixed gear to learn and enjoy a different side of riding.

It should arrive on Friday and hopefully I can have it assembled and get comfortable before having to go to work. (I might just ride it there to show it off.)
