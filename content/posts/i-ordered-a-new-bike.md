I bought a new bike. It took me months of research, but I finally pulled the trigger on the \[Trek Allant+ 8s\]([https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/electric-hybrid-bikes/allant/allant-8s/p/30265/](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/electric-hybrid-bikes/allant/allant-8s/p/30265/ "https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/electric-hybrid-bikes/allant/allant-8s/p/30265/")). The plan is to use this e-bike to commute to and from work and around the city. 

When I was in college I didn't own a car and hated to drive (I still do). I didn't get my drivers license until I was 18 and then didn't drive again for almost 5 years. My primary form of transportation was one of my two bikes. It was either my Specialized Sirrus Sport or more often my \[modified State Bike fixie\]([https://duffy.xyz/2012/ordered-my-first-fixed-gear/](https://duffy.xyz/2012/ordered-my-first-fixed-gear/ "https://duffy.xyz/2012/ordered-my-first-fixed-gear/")). 

Since graduating college and moving to San Francisco I have taken muni for commuting to work and the car on weekends for shopping and groceries and everything else. I have kept my bikes, but they have been collecting dust for years. I have only ridden a bike in the city a handful of times. Mostly due to concerns over safety and my own lack of confidence on the streets here. Despite riding all the time in Turlock the city feels different and a lot more busy than I am used to.

Every time I have changed companies or offices each has been a bit further from our apartment. Now my daily commute on muni is about an hour on a good day and 2-3 times a month there is some issue with the train that increases that commute to something closer to 90 minutes or more. That is an hour EACH WAY.

A conservative estimate for biking to my office in soma from the outer sunset is about \~40 minutes. So a bike could save me at least 20 minutes on my commute each way. If I can do that a bit faster on an e-bike I might be able to save almost 40-50 minutes a day that I would otherwise be sitting on a train or about 3.5 to 4 hours a week.

I have been looking at e-bikes for awhile and watching the new Allant+ since it was announced last year. Not many reviews are out, but things look promising from the early adopters. I have rented a few of the Jump electric bikes and Lyft bikes and they are great for getting around and often faster than taking the train or bus. When Aubrey and I finally made the trip to the Trek store to try one out it was pretty magical. I felt like I was a kid again riding the bike the few blocks around the store.

I can hardly wait to be on a bike again. It is something that I have missed since moving to the city. Cycling used to be a big part of my identity and I hope to revive that part of myself. The Allant+ bikes are still pretty new so I had to make a special order and I should be able to pick the bike up from the store in the next week or two.

It is going to be a long couple weeks while I wait...
