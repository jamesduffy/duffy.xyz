I am passionate about the web. Long hours programming and scaling machines in the cloud is my norm. I have helped build high traffic websites both professionally and for fun. I live and work in San Francisco.

I graduated from California State University, Stanislaus with a B.S. degree in Computer Information Systems in Fall of 2014.
