I am passionate about the web and building stuff that matters. Long hours programming and scaling machines in the cloud is my norm. I have helped build high traffic websites both professionally and for fun.

My work has helped me become proficient in tools and languages such as Python, Ansible, Grafana, RabbitMQ, Redis, PHP, Laravel, Symfony, Django, AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, MongoDB, and MySQL.

I graduated from California State University, Stanislaus with a B.S. degree in Computer Information Systems in Fall of 2014. In addition to my technical classes I excelled in Team Communications, Management Science, Operations Management, Business Technical Writing and Business Strategy.
