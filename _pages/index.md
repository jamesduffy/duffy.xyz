I believe in using the right tool for the job, not just what is trending. A great team will always outperform the individual and that is why I focus on elevating my team up and not just myself.

My work has helped me become proficient in tools and languages such as Python, Ansible, Grafana, RabbitMQ, Redis, PHP, Laravel, Symfony, Django, AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, MongoDB, and MySQL.

I am passionate about the web and building stuff that matters. Long hours programming and scaling machines in the cloud is my norm. I have helped build high traffic websites both professionally and for fun.

I graduated from California State University, Stanislaus with a B.S. degree in Computer Information Systems in Fall of 2014. In addition to my technical classes I excelled in Team Communications, Management Science, Operations Management, Business Technical Writing and Business Strategy.
