### Why
A lot of people will cite that they decided to get their Amateur radio license to prepare for a disaster or an emergency. I agree that this is still a big part of the hobby, but Amateur radio (HAM Radio) is a hobby and not a job.

Personally I have always been drawn to decentralized communication. It is part of the reason I am a software engineer today. I have always wanted to get my HAM Radio license (something that my dad has had since before I was born). It took me years to finally find the time to study and take the test.

I took my technician exam in October 2017 and finally joined the HAM hobby.

### Getting Licensed
Before you are allowed to use and operate a HAM radio you must first take a test and get a license from the FCC (if you are in the United States).

### Fun things to do
After you get licensed there is a whole world of things to explore. Below I have started to make a list of things I have experimented with and.

#### [APRS](http://aprs.org/)
APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) is a digital communication system that from as far as I can tell right now is mainly used for sharing your position, basic statuses and simple messages.

One of the fun things that I have found is that there is a way to send SMS messages to friends and family through a SMS gateway. This could be something fun to try out and can be useful if you do not have cell service, but can get your message into the APRS network. [Check out the SMS gateway for more instructions](http://smsgte.wixsite.com/smsgte).
