### Why
A lot of people will cite that they decided to get their Amateur radio license to prepare for a disaster or an emergency. I agree that this is still a big part of the hobby, but Amateur radio (HAM Radio) is a hobby and not a job like firefighting or being a police officer.

Personally I really like the idea of a decentralized way to communicate. It is something that initially drew me to the web and why I am a software engineer today. I have always wanted to get my HAM Radio license (something that my dad has had since before I was born). It took me years to finally find the time to study and take the test.

I took my technician exam on October 29, 2017 and finally joined the HAM hobby.

Below are a list of things that I have found useful while studying to become a HAM Radio operator and in the day-to-day usage of my license.
