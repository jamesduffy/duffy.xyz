title: Side Projects
---

A few months ago I started my first full time job since graduating college. I am working with some great people and making meaningful contributions to the team and the company.

Working the many hours that a startup requires has meant I have had many great ideas and frustrations related to my work that could be solved with a small side project. I have written down at least three good ones, but I have no time to work on them even though they may only require a day to build.

Right now weekends are filled with renovating a place my girlfriend and I will be moving in San Francisco at the end of July, but maybe I can start sneaking in a day of work on weekends after we move.
