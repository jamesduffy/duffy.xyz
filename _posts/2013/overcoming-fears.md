title: Overcoming Fears
---

To overcome fear you must face it. My fear was riding my bicycle in the pouring rain. That’s why I made it a personal mission to get up and ride through the pain, through the discomfort. My hands were unbearably cold. It was not easy and my stomach would turn as I walked out the door. After about two months of riding whenever it would rain I started to embrace it and understand how to handle it better. I don’t prefer riding in the rain, no where close, but when it is raining it doesn’t make me uncomfortable. I know that even through the cold rain I can still find warmth by pedaling harder and keeping my concentration on the moment rather than my thoughts.
